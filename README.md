# Better Theme Extension Pack

VSCode is a beautiful by default. But it can be better.
To fix this, I made this extension pack that add some themes to VSCode.

## List of extensions built-in

- dracula-theme.theme-dracula
- enkia.tokyo-night
- file-icons.file-icons
- GitHub.github-vscode-theme
- liviuschera.noctis

**Enjoy!**
